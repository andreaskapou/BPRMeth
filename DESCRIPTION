Description: The BPRMeth package is a probabilistic method to quantify explicit 
    features of methylation profiles, in a way that would make it easier to 
    formally use such profiles in downstream modelling efforts, such as 
    predicting gene expression levels or clustering genomic regions or cells 
    according to their methylation profiles.
