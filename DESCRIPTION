Description: The BPRMeth package is a probabilistic method to quantify explicit 
    features of methylation profiles, in a way that would make it easier to 
    formally use such profiles in downstream modelling efforts, such as 
    predicting gene expression levels or clustering genomic regions according 
    to their methylation profiles.
