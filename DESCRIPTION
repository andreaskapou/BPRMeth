Description: BPRMeth package uses the Binomial Probit Regression likelihood 
    to model methylation profiles and extract higher order features. These 
    features quantitate precisely notions of shape of a methylation profile. 
    Using these higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, we 
    construct a powerful predictor of gene expression. Also, these features 
    are used to cluster proximal-promoter regions using the EM algorithm.
