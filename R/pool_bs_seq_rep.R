#' Read and pool replicates from BS-Seq data
#'
#' \code{pool_bs_seq_rep} reads and pools replicate methylation data from BS-Seq
#' experiments that are either in Encode RRBS or Bismark Cov format. Read the
#' Important section below on when to use this function.
#'
#' @inheritParams preprocess_bs_seq
#'
#' @return A \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} object. The GRanges object
#'   contains two additional metadata columns: \itemize{ \item
#'   \code{total_reads}: total reads mapped to each genomic location. \item
#'   \code{meth_reads}: methylated reads mapped to each genomic location. }
#'   These columns can be accessed as follows: granges_object$total_reads
#'
#' @section Important: Unless you want to create a different workflow when
#'   processing the BS-Seq data, you should NOT call this function, since this
#'   is a helper function. Instead you should call the
#'   \code{\link{preprocess_bs_seq}} function.
