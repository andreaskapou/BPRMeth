# BPRMeth: modelling DNA methylation profiles

The aim of `BPRMeth` is to extract higher order features associated with the shape of methylation profiles across a defined genomic region. Using these higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, BPRMeth provides a powerful machine learning predictor of gene expression. Check the vignette on how to use the package. Modelling details for the different models can be found online: [http://rpubs.com/cakapourani](http://rpubs.com/cakapourani).

The original implementation has now been enhanced in two important ways: we introduced a fast, __variational inference__ approach which enables the quantification of Bayesian posterior confidence measures on the model, and we adapted the method to use several observation models, making it suitable for a diverse range of platforms including __single-cell__ and __bulk__ sequencing experiments and __methylation arrays__. 


## Installation
To get the latest development version from Github:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andreaskapou/BPRMeth", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Or install from the stable release version from Bioconductor
```R
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("BPRMeth")
```

You can the check the vignette on how to use the package:
```R
browseVignettes("BPRMeth")
```

## Clang / fopenmp error for Mac users
If you get the following error when installing the package:

`clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'`

try the following:
```R
brew install llvm
brew install boost
brew install homebrew/science/hdf5 --enable-cxx

mkdir -p ~/.R
vim ~/.R/Makevars

## Paste the following commands
# The following statements are required to use the clang4 binary
CC=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang
CXX=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang++
CXX11=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang++
CXX14=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang++
CXX17=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang++
CXX1X=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang++
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/clang4/lib
# End clang4 inclusion statements
```
These commands will point R to the new version of clang.
