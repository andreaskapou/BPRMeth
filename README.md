# BPRMeth

The aim of BPRMeth is to extract higher order features associated with the shape of methylation profiles across a defined genomic region. Using these higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, BPRMeth provides a powerful machine learning predictor of gene expression. Check the vignette on how to use the package.
