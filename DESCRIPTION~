Description: BPRMeth package uses the Binomial Probit Regression likelihood to
    model methylation profiles and extract higher order features. These features
    quantitate precisely notions of shape of a methylation profile. Using these
    higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, we construct a powerful
    predictor of gene expression. Also, these features are used to cluster proximal-
    promoter regions using the EM algorithm.
